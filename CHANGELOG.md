# Changelog

## 0.0.2 - 2018-01-08 - The one that can use old package databases
### Overview
- Now with repository rewinding working, for when your pkgs.db is older than
  your git checkout
- More resilient package import server (pkgimport-master)
### Added
- Now pkgimport-master will survive the death of an agent, where previously
  agents remained as zombies, accepting jobs but never completing them,
  preventing legitimate workers from doing jobs.
- Packages repo rewinding
- Reading all pipes to the end at a cost of at least 6 syscalls per package
  import.

  tested that functionality just yet.
