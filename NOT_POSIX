The following parts of the code are not POSIX compatible and are deliberately
not written to the POSIX spec
(which can be found at http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/nframe.html )

- closefrom(int) in the forking code is provided by libbsd.
  - No longer this way since forking happens outside of threaded contexts,
    removing the primary purpose of closefrom() as a way to abate the problems
    with forking and threading while playing with file descriptors.
- arc4random() in bworker generating 32 bit "check" values, provided by libbsd.
- There is inotify code, Linux specific, in `brepowatch.c`. This should be
  expanded to support other systems as desired.

All other parts of the codebase are deliberately written to only assume
functionality as laid out in those specifications. If part of the code assumes
something that is not in the spec, that is a bug.
