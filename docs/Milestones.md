AMVP:
    - Poked by git
    - Pokes xbulk
    - Repeat.

MVP-1.0
    - Poked by git
    - Determine what to build using the xbulk algorithm
    - Go ask builders to build it

MVP-1.1
    - Poked by git
    - Determine what to build using the xbulk algorithm
    - Go ask builders to build it
    - Copy files back to the master using a sane mechanism.
    - Still requires builders to have full state of the repo, but the main repo
      no longer should be the main builder.

MVP-1.2
    - Poked by git
    - Determine what to build using the xbulk algorithm
    - Go ask builders to build it
    - Copy files back to the master using a sane mechanism.
    - xbps-src instances only use the master as the source of the repo.

MVP-1.3
    - Poked by git
    - Determine what to build using the xbulk algorithm
    - Go ask builders to build it
    - Copy files back to the master using a sane mechanism.
    - xbps-src instances only use the master as the source of the repo.
    - Begins to understand when to not ask a builder to build (nocross
      situations).

MVP-1.4
    - Poked by git
    - Determine what to build using the xbulk algorithm
    - Go ask builders to build it
    - Copy files back to the master using a sane mechanism.
    - xbps-src instances only use the master as the source of the repo.
    - Allows multiple builders to be on each architecture.
