# Contributing Rules

Open every PR and commit with a problem statement. Lacking features is not
a problem, but failing to properly do X is a problem, and that can lead to
a feature. It is a problem when there are no tests for a feature. Every PR and
commit must have a problem statement.

The second paragraph in a commit should start "Solution: " and that's where you
have a written description of how you solve the problem.
