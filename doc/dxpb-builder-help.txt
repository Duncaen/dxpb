usage: dxpb-builder [arguments]

Arguments:
  -h		This help, and exit
  -L		Print license information and exit
  -g <endpoint>	ZeroMQ endpoint to connect to the package grapher
  -k <dir>	Directory with owner-only read/write for storing curve keys
                If not specified at all or the directory does not exist with
		read permissions, no encryption will be performed, warnings
		will be printed, and the entire setup will be unfit for
		operation over an insecure network.
  -H <dir>	Hostdir builder can use
  -m <dir>	Masterdir builder can use
  -x <path>	Path to xbps-src executable

The following flags have defaults.
  -H: ./hostdir
  -g: tcp://127.0.0.1:5195
  -k: /etc/dxpb/curve/
  -m: ./masterdir
  -x: ./xbps-src

It is important to note that, if -k is valid, the client key used by this
process will be whatever argument 0 is to the process, appended with ".key".
For example, if you call
`chpst -u xbuilder1 -b builder1 /usr/bin/dxpb-builder`, then the key
`/etc/dxpb/curve/builder1.key` will be used to authenticate to the server.
