usage: dxpb-hostdir-remote [arguments]

Arguments:
  -h		This help, and exit
  -L		Print license information and exit
  -r <dir>	Hostdir/binpkgs which is the root of where packages are stored.
		Must have read/write access.
  -k <dir>	Directory with owner-only read/write for storing curve keys
                If not specified, no encryption will be performed, warnings
		will be printed, and the entire setup will be unfit for
		operation over an insecure network.
  -f <endpoint>	ZeroMQ endpoint for connecting to the hostdir agent. A default
		is provided, but mostly for testing purposes.

The following flags have defaults.
  -r: ./
  -k: /etc/dxpb/curve/
  -f: tcp://127.0.0.1:5196

-f has a default simply for matters of testing, though with ssh trickery the
default may be usable in a production setup.
