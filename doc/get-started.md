# Quick Start

You need to obtain the source, build the source, and then spin up dxpb.

First step: `git clone https://gitlab.com/Vaelatern/dxpb.git`

Second step: `cd dxpb; cd src; make; cd -`

Third, you need to spin up dxpb. A small cluster operating on only your
computer can be spun up with `runsvdir -P ./runsv/`.

### Where to go from here

The scripts under ./runsv can be modified or removed to alter functionality as
needed in your use case.
